# AI-Powered-Tshirt-Graphic-Recommendation-System
Tshirtify is an AI-powered semantic retrieval system that recommends T-shirt graphics from free-text prompts. Using OpenAI’s CLIP model, it maps text and images into a shared embedding space and ranks designs via cosine similarity. It works in a zero-shot, label-free manner without manual tagging or supervised training.
